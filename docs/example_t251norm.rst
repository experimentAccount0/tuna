Calibration lamp T251 (normalized)
==================================

This data cube was supplied by Beno√Æt Epinat and corresponds to the calibration lamp imaged before data aquisition in a run made to observe T251. The image was normalized (flattened).

The reduction was made using Tuna version 0.16.4. The code to reduce the image was::

  import time
  import tuna
  tuna.log.set_path ( "test.log" )
  tuna.log.verbose ( "file", "DEBUG" )
  
  def reduce_test ( file_name ):
    file_object = tuna.io.read ( file_name )
    start = time.time ( )
    reducer = tuna.pipelines.calibration_lamp_high_resolution.reducer (
      calibration_wavelength = 6598.953125,
      finesse = 12,
      free_spectral_range = 8.36522123894,
      interference_order = 791,
      interference_reference_wavelength = 6562.7797852,
      pixel_size = 9,
      scanning_wavelength = 6616.89,
      tuna_can = file_object,
      channel_subset = [ 0, 1, 2, 5 ],
      continuum_to_FSR_ratio = 0.125,
      noise_mask_radius = 8,
      dont_fit = False,
      unwrapped_only = False,
      verify_center = None )
    reducer.join ( )
    print ( "Tuna took {:.1f}s to reduce.".format ( time.time ( ) - start ) )
    return reducer
  
  test = reduce_test ( "/home/nix/cold_store/fpdata_T251_Benoit_Epinat_2015-07-22/T251_norm.fits" )
  tuna.tools.plot_high_res ( test )
