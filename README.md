Tuna
====

Tuna is a Tunable Fabry-Perot Interferometer Data Reduction software solution.

It uses ZeroMQ as a communications hub between its modules.

It uses Astropy for several tasks.

It is written in Python, but since ZeroMQ has wrappers for several languages, it is possible to rewrite modules in other languages.
