class noise_detector ( threading.Thread ):
    """
    This class is responsible for detecting noise from a raw Fabry-PÃ©rot interferogram.

    It inherits from the :ref:`threading_label`.Thread class, and it auto-starts its thread execution. Clients are expected to use its .join ( ) method before using its results.

    Its constructor expects the following parameters:

    - raw, a numpy.ndarray containing the raw interferometry data;
    - wrapped, a numpy.ndarray containing the wrapped phase map;
    - noise_mask_radius, an integer encoding the radius (in pixels) of the circle to be marked as noisy around each pixel detected as noisy;
    - noise_threshold, a float encoding the minimum value to be considered noise.

    Usage:

    The noise_mask_radius is useful to "fill" small gaps inside noise regions. Some tools (such as the ones used to produce fsr maps) relie on the noise being made of "continuous" pixel sets. By increasing this parameter, it is possible to force noisy regions to overlap and become "continuous", if they aren't.
